# Phrase Stress Match

Matches a user-input English phrase with phrases from an external list, based on stress patterns.  Stress is taken from the cmudict corpus in nltk (http://www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/corpus/reader/cmudict.html).

A silly thing put together in procrastination time.  Originally designed to match peopleâ€™s names with pop songs, but it works a little better with phrases.
